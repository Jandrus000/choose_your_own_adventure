# Overview

I created a choose your own adventure web app using React. There are 16 different endings to the game. Each path is portrayed with an AI generated image. There is also a timer in the top right to time how long it takes to reach a "good ending". The command `npm start` entered in the terminal inside the "choose_your_own_adventure" directory will run a local server to run the app. This should take you to the correct starting screen. Node JS and React should be installed to run the local server.

The purpose of this app is to learn the basic utility, syntax, and framework of a React app. And to also create an app that is fun and interactive.

# Web Pages

This app uses one-web page that is re-rendered dependent on user choice. There is 31 different renderings of the page that are dependent on user choice.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE, and I used the React java script framework.
